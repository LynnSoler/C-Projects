ASP.NET C#-MVC Web Application

This is a Car Insurance App created with ASP.NET C#-MVC structure + scaffolded views using Code-First EF6. Both front + back-end code was handled in Visual Studio 2017 with cshtml, css, and cs stacks to complete the visual + logic challenges this application originally presented. This was the first MVC-Web Application I applied scaffolded views to which increased my speed and understanding with the Model-View-Controller functions in ASP.NET.
