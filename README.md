ASP.NET C#-MVC Web Application

This is a Car Insurance App created with ASP.NET 4.6 C#-MVC 5 structure + Scaffolded views using Code-First EF6. Both front + back-end code was handled in Visual Studio 2017 with cshtml, Razor markup, css, and cs stacks to complete the visual + logic challenges this application  presented. This was the first MVC-Web Application I applied scaffolded views to which not only increased my speed (by creating the database + tables first), but gave me a deeper understanding of the Model-View-Controller functions within the MS .NET Framework.
